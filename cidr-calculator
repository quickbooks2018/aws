Example 1
---------
20.20.0.0/20  --->2^12 = 4096/256=16 (32-20) 4+8=12
8.8.4.4.8

20.20.16.0/20

20.20.32.0/20

# Formula for calculating the number of IP addresses in a CIDR block
Number of IPs = 2^(32 - subnet mask)

# In this case, the subnet mask is 20
subnet_mask = 20
number_of_ips = 2 ** (32 - subnet_mask)

# The calculation would be:
Number of IPs = 2^(32 - 20) = 2^12

# Calculating the exact number
number_of_ips = 2 ** (32 - subnet_mask)

# Output the number of IPs in the CIDR block 20.20.32.0/20
("The CIDR block 20.20.32.0/20 contains", number_of_ips, "IP addresses.")





Example 2
----------
10.10.0.0/19    ---> 2^13 = 8192/256=32 (32-19)   5+8=13
8.8.3.5.8

10.10.32.0/19

10.10.64.0.0/19

Example 3
----------
10.205.0.0/22 ---> 2^10 = 1024/256=4 (32-22)   8+2=10
8.8.6.2.8 

6 ---> means /22
11x4=44
12x4=48

Example 4
---------
10.10.0.0/16 ---> vpc

10.10.64.0/18 ---> 2^14 = 16,384/256=64 (32-18=14)
see /18 & count 8.8.2.6.8
             /18 8+8+2 ---> remaining 6+8=14 see above (32-18=14)

10.10.128.0/18
      (64+64)

10.10.192.0/18
      (128+64)


To convert an IP address from decimal (like 192.168.13.10) to binary, follow these steps for each octet (each part of the IP address separated by a period).

Steps:
1. Convert Decimal to Binary:
Each octet (number) is converted to binary. Here's how to do it:

Start with the decimal number.
Repeatedly divide the number by 2, recording the remainder each time.
Continue until the quotient is 0.
The binary number is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top (reverse order).
Example: Converting 192 to Binary
Divide 192 by 2:
192
÷
2
=
96
192÷2=96 remainder 0

Divide 96 by 2:
96
÷
2
=
48
96÷2=48 remainder 0

Divide 48 by 2:
48
÷
2
=
24
48÷2=24 remainder 0

Divide 24 by 2:
24
÷
2
=
12
24÷2=12 remainder 0

Divide 12 by 2:
12
÷
2
=
6
12÷2=6 remainder 0

Divide 6 by 2:
6
÷
2
=
3
6÷2=3 remainder 0

Divide 3 by 2:
3
÷
2
=
1
3÷2=1 remainder 1

Divide 1 by 2:
1
÷
2
=
0
1÷2=0 remainder 1


2. Repeat the process for each octet.
168:
Following the same process, the binary form of 168 is 10101000.

13:
For 13, divide and get 00001101.

10:
For 10, divide and get 00001010.

3. Combine the Binary Octets:
Now you combine each of the binary octets into a single 32-bit representation:

192 → 11000000
168 → 10101000
13 → 00001101
10 → 00001010
So, the full IP address 192.168.13.10 in binary is:


11000000.10101000.00001101.00001010
Each of these binary octets represents 8 bits, which is why IPv4 addresses are 32 bits (4 octets of 8 bits each).

Summary Table:
Decimal	Binary
192	11000000
168	10101000
13	00001101
10	00001010
You can use this process to convert any decimal number to binary.



IP Address: The address "192.168.13.10" is shown in both decimal (the common format we use) and binary form (how computers process it).

The binary form of the IP is: 11000000 10101000 11001101 00001010.
Subnet Mask: The subnet mask "255.255.255.0" is used to divide the network and host portions of the IP address. The binary form of the subnet mask is: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000.

The "1"s in the subnet mask indicate the network portion of the IP address, while the "0"s indicate the host portion.
Network Portion: In the image, the first three octets (192.168.13) represent the network part of the IP address, as indicated by the purple underlining. This is determined by the subnet mask (255.255.255.0), which has all 1's in the first three octets and 0's in the last octet.

Host Portion: The last octet (10) is the host portion, highlighted with a red underline. This part can vary within the network, representing different devices or systems within the same subnet.

Summary:
The network is represented by "192.168.13" (or 11000000 10101000 11001101 in binary).
The host within that network is represented by ".10" (or 00001010 in binary).

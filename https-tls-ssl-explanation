TLS Overview:

TLS:
Authentication ✅
Data Protection ✅
Data Integrity ✅
HTTP + TLS = HTTPS ✅
Key Types:

Asymmetric Key:
Two keys: Public Key (encrypts data), Private Key (decrypts data) ✅
Slow but able to perform authentication ✅
Symmetric Key:
Performs both encryption and decryption ✅
Unable to perform authentication but fast ✅
Certificate Authority (CA):

CA signs certificates with its own private key (Digitally Signed) ✅
Once issued, installed on server ✅
Digital Signing:

Sign with your private key, verify with your public key ✅
Server-side CSR:

Server generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) ✅
CA signs the CSR with its private key (Digitally Signed) ✅

TLS Session:

Handshake Phase: Purpose is authentication ✅
Encryption Phase ✅
Session:

A conversation between two parties for a limited or unlimited time ✅
Client-Server Communication:

Client sends "hello" to server ✅
Server sends its public key and certificate ✅
Client verifies the certificate with CA; once verified, uses server's public key to encrypt a message ✅
Server decrypts the message with its private key ✅
Secret String:

Both client and server use the secret string and other information to generate a Master Key ✅
Session Key:

Client generates a Session Key using the Master Key ✅
Server generates a Session Key using the Master Key ✅
Session Key is a symmetric key used for encryption and decryption ✅
Encryption Algorithms: AES-256-GCM and CHACHA20 ✅
Session Security:

Session becomes secure and fast ✅
MAC (Message Authentication Code):

Each encrypted message includes a MAC key ✅
If MACs match between client and server, data integrity is confirmed (no tampering) ✅

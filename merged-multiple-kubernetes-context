Yes, you can merge two Kubernetes cluster configurations into a single configuration using the kubectl config view command along with some shell redirection. Here's a basic example:

# First, you need to set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to include both of your kubeconfig files. You can do this with the following command

export KUBECONFIG=./8443:./6443

Next, you can use the kubectl config view --flatten command to merge the configurations and output a single, unified kubeconfig. If you want to save this to a file, you can use shell redirection:

kubectl config view --flatten > merged_config


export KUBECONFIG=merged_config



Again, replace ~/.kube/merged_config with the actual path to your merged kubeconfig file.

Remember that the export commands only set the environment variable for the current shell session. If you want to set it permanently, you'll need to add the export command to your shell's initialization file (like ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile for the Bash shell).

Please note that the kubectl config view --flatten command discards information about the location of the original kubeconfig files, and some other non-essential information. If you have multiple contexts with the same name in different files, they will be merged into one, which might not be what you want. Always check the merged kubeconfig file to make sure it's correct.

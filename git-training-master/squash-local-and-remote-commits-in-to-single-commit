To squash all local and remote commits into a single commit with the message "devops position assessment", you'll need to perform the following steps:

Please note:

This process rewrites history, so only do this if you're sure no one else is working on this branch.
The --force flag is necessary because you're rewriting history.
This action is irreversible and will lose the detailed commit history. Make sure you really want to do this.
If this is a shared repository, communicate with your team before performing these actions.


1.Ensure you have the latest changes:
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

2.Reset your local branch to the initial commit:
git reset --soft $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)

3.Stage all changes:
git add .

4.Commit with the desired message:
git commit -m "devops position assessment"

5.Force push to update the remote repository:
git push origin main --force

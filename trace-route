MTR (My TraceRoute) is a network diagnostic tool used in Linux and other operating systems. The command "mtr" combines the functionality of traceroute and ping. 

mtr --tcp <target_host_or_ip>

mtr --tcp -P <port_number> <target_host_or_ip>

mtr --tcp -P 80 google.com
mtr -P 80 google.com
This command would use TCP on port 80 instead of ICMP.
